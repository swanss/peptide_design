     initial set - the set of residues that the user wants to generate combinations from
     k           - the number of elements in the combinations
     
     The user should envision a tree structure where each node represents an initial set with some
     associated k. For each member of the set the function will be called recursively with 1) k
     decremented by 1 and 2) the selected member removed from the set. For each recursive call to the
     function, a new node, one level below is generated with the associated variables and an edge is drawn.
     At the bottom of the tree, an empty vector of vectors is returned. If the initial set becomes empty
     before the bottom of the tree is reached, the entire branch becomes void.
     
     Example:
     
     from [1,2,3] choose all combinations of two objects
     
     k = 2               [1,2,3]

     k = 1          [2,3]  [3]  []
     current res   2/ 3\   3|
     k = 0       [3]   []  []
     
     each branch that reaches the level where k = 0 generates a combination; the current residues
     along each path from the top node to the bottom nodes form the set.

     An analytical approach to calculating the fraction of volume around a residue occupied by atoms.
     
     NOTE: does not work. In order to accurately calculate the occupied volume using this approach must consider pairwise and higher
     order overlaps, otherwise will double count. This is hard to do, see this paper that used complicated geometry to solve this:
     https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00291a006
     
     The idea was to sum up the volume of VDW spheres within the "query sphere", the space we were searching for atoms. From this we
     would subtract the pairwise overlaps between VDW spheres, which otherwise would be double counted. The issue is that this
     overcorrects, so in cases where we have higher-order overlaps (which does happen) we would be missing that volume. Beyond this,
     when finding pairwise overlaps, it is important to calculate how much of this falls inside the query sphere, but this is also difficult and
     not done here. Instead that area is just ignored.
